# Holy Grail War 

Holy Grail War is a competition between seven wizards in a popular novel. 

Each wizard should use magic to call an epic hero who is very famous in history as wizard's servant. The magical rite for calling an epic hero needs some ancient relics which belong to the hero. What would be happened when King Arthur against Alexander is one of the interesting points in this novel.  

Holy Grail War is a death game, wizards and their servants join this war for winning the Holy Grail which could make a wish come true. In consideration of only one team could be alive in the end, so joining this game must have some very strong reason. Compared with wizards want to be the greatest magic master, heroes have different wishes that are related to their tragic ending in history. For example, King Arthur wants to save his people, Scottish, which were defeated by British, while Alexander wants to rule the world, and Gilgamesh who is the king of Babylon believes the prize of this game, the Holy Grail, must belong to his treasury which contains all treasures in the world, so Gilgamesh decide to punish others just like a thief.

Action scenes are very interesting too. Arthur holds his sword which is pulled out from the stone, and Alexander could call his Macedonian army.

Reading this novel requires some knowledge about foreign history, but the setting of this game is very open and many fans could write themselves fan fiction for it. I have ever read one version that Mao Zedong and Cao Cao are joining this game.

Which wish would you be made, if you join this war?
