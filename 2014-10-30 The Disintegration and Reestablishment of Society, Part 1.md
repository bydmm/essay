# The Disintegration and Reestablishment of Society, Part 1

When 10,000 of people travel to the another world, the society is totally collapsed. It's occurring in a recent animation, but it is very similar to that when Hurricane Katrina completely destroyed several states' order in 2005, there is no government, no police and no military.

At first, players are shocked that why they travel to the world in a game when they just opened it. And then, some adaptable person starting to explore the new world compares with who keep close to the very center of town, the safe area. 

Quickly, they find people cannot die that they will rebirth immediately in the great church after they die. Some people start to rob and kill others without any sense of guilt. Society is starting to collapse. So, most people join in guilds to protect themself, but nothing is changed, all power has been controlled by the leader of big guilds, there is no hope for the town.

This world lacks of materials and cultural life, no film, no KTV, and the biggest problem is the taste of the food. Collect some ingredients and spices and then use the cooking skills on it, food, which looks delicious but utterly tasteless, will jump out from some white smoke as same as what we do in the game!

It's seems nothing can save this world, but someone and his friends are determined to rescue this world...
