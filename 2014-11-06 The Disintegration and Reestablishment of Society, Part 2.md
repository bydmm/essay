# The Disintegration and Reestablishment of Society, Part 2

In this part, I will change all charactersâ€˜ name to the English name for enhancing the identity of characters, which far better than the Japanese name.

There is nothing worse than eating horrible food day after day, but our protagonist, Snape, finds a way to solve it. He is a man who is fighting for justice by any means necessary. So he uses the way for making money compare with just sharing the secret of cooking.

When everybody knows there is a restaurant could offer awesome food and is waiting in long lines, Snape is beginning negotiating with some big businessman in a very important meeting. He asks one million gold coins. That is very huge money in the world of game where sleeping in a hotel one night only needs one gold coin. Greenspan, one of the leaders of chamber of commerces, question why Snape needs so much money, Snape say everyone has freedom to quit this meeting but lose a big opportunity for making big money, all businessman easily surrender.

A few days late, Snape convene another meeting which invites 10 chairmen from different guilds, because he is very famous, so everyone on the list attends. Snape appeal to found a round table discussion for reestablishing the order of society. One leader quit immediately, he thinks it is a bored thing to set up a government in a game. Another leader threat that his big guild could break any rule of this useless round table discussion set.

When this talking is going to break down, Snape smile and show he has bought the guild hall. In this game, To join or quit a guild and the bank for guilds is in the guild hall, any guild could not operate without this building.Now Snape own this house, and he could reject anyone entering this house. This is the right given by the system of the game.

Snape says every guild need to respect fundamental human rights and protect it, "No guild could use the guild hall if it doesn't obey this basic principle".

For subsiding anger, Snape not only public the way of making nice food, but also tell everyone that this world is a special world liking game, not a game simulating a world. The way of cooking delicious food like the way in the real world, for example barbecue meat on fire, season with spice and the cooker must high-level of cooking skills. Even player has carpentry skills could build furniture which originally not in the game.

This discovery opens the door to the better future. Better food, better clothing and better life are made, people who originally doing nothing start to work and cheer up, and the street of town becomes busy and alive.
